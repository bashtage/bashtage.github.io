## RandomGen (randomgen)

**This project has been substantially merged into NumPy 1.17.**
**There are some features remaining that have not been integrated, especially**
**additional bit generators (Psuedo RNGs).**

Replacement for NumPy's RandomState using a plug-in framework that separates
complex random variate generatrion from basic random number generation

## ng-numpy-randomstate (randomstate)

**This project has been mothballed. Use [randomgen](https://github.com/bashtage/randomgen)**

Drop-in replacement for NumPy's RandomState supporting more advanced generators
